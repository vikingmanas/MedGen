## 🚀 Features
- 🗣️ **Interactive Conversations**: Engage with MedGen in natural language to get insightful answers to your medical queries.
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses advanced **LLM** techniques for accurate and context-aware responses.
- 🏥 **Medical Knowledge Base**: Trained on medical data to provide information on symptoms, diseases, treatments, and more.
- 🌍 **Multiple Use Cases**: From symptom analysis to general health advice, MedGen can handle a wide range of medical topics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the chatbot's backend.
- **Transformers**: Leveraging Hugging Face's Transformer models for NLP tasks.
- **OpenAI GPT**: Integrated GPT-based models for generating intelligent responses.
- **Flask/FastAPI**: For web app deployment and API handling (if applicable).

## 💬 How It Works
**MedGen** uses the **transformers** library to load pretrained LLM models (like GPT or fine-tuned medical models).  
User input is passed through the model, which generates a relevant and accurate response based on the query.  
The bot can answer a wide range of medical-related questions, including symptoms, diseases, treatments, and preventive measures.

## 🎯 Use Cases
- **Symptom Analysis**: Input symptoms and get insights on possible conditions.
- **Medical Information**: Ask about medical conditions, treatments, and general health advice.
- **Health Tips**: Get advice on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, nutrition, and exercise.

## 🌟 Example Conversations
